### The labour market
At the start of 2026, the latest data released on U.S. unemployment leaves us with a sobering outlook for the new year.

Recent figures indicate that the U.S. unemployment rate rose to 4.6% in November 2025, slightly above forecasts, which had projected 4.5%.

However, it is important to note that this data represents the first full jobs report since the federal shutdown that began in October 2025.

### The Inflation 

In other hand, we have promising data when the matter is about CPI. 

Recent figures show that inflation remains under control despite the impact of tariffs on prices.

This development encourages the Federal Reserve to feel more comfortable with its decision to reduce the federal funds rate.

Indeed, according to the latest FOMC minutes, the rate was reduced by 25 basis points.

As a result, the federal funds rate now stands at 3.88%.

### Real rate 

As we find ourselves amid the dilemma of continuing to reduce interest rates, it is useful to examine additional indicators such as the real interest rate.

The real rate provides insight into market expectations and the impact of current monetary policy on the broader economy.

However, first we need to take a look at 10-year U.S. Treasury yields (US10Y), we observe that they remain at 4.19%.

When you subtract the yield on inflation-protected bonds (TIPS) from the nominal Treasury yield, you are estimating the real interest rate.


Nominal yield (10Y Treasury) = 4.19%

10Y TIPS yield ~2.2%

Breakeven inflation ≈ 2.0%

Now with this data (BreakevenInflation) tells us how much investors are earning after inflation, not just in nominal terms.

### The conclusion

In summary, this environment leaves the Federal Reserve with a clearer path to continue gradually reducing the federal funds rate, as inflation remains under control and the labor market shows signs of cooling.

However, breakeven inflation and real yields suggest that the economy is still operating under restrictive financial conditions, with borrowing costs remaining elevated. This contributes to slower economic momentum, as investors continue to favor holding bonds over reallocating capital into riskier assets.

Therefore, a reduction in the federal funds rate alone may not be sufficient to meaningfully ease financial conditions. A shift toward balance sheet expansion—through renewed bond purchases, would help lower long-term yields, support credit creation, and gradually move real rates toward a more neutral stance, while keeping inflation expectations anchored.

Keep in mind, dear rader, that a shift toward more expansive policy through renewed bond purchases, could compress TIPS yields more aggressively than nominal yields. While this would ease financial conditions, it may also lead to a rise in breakeven inflation, signaling higher long-term inflation expectations.
